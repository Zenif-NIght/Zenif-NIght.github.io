Hi, I am Christopher, a PhD student robotics researcher at USU. My expertise is in both data science and robotic intelligence. With experience as a software engineer, I have a passion for building autonomous systems and computer vision applications. I have worked with both wheeled and dynamic quadruped robots on a range of research projects.


## Research Interests

*  Robotics control and motion planning
*  Autonomous systems and robotics
*  Natural language processing
*  Bio-inspired robotics
*  Machine learning and deep learning
*  Computer vision and perception
*  Human-robot interaction

### LLAMA  -- Jun 2021 - Aug 2021

<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="width: 50%;">
    <!-- Your text content here -->
   As part of my work with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) I worked on the Legged Locomotion and Movement Adaptation (LLAMA) robot. I ustalise the joint data to accurately predict the terrain the robot is walking on.

### USU Mars Rover  -- Aug 2020 - May 2021

<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="width: 50%;">
    <!-- Your text content here -->
    I worked on the USU Mars Rover team to develop a robot that can navigate autonomously in a simulated Mars environment. I worked on the computer vision system to detect and avoid obstacles. I also worked on the communication system to allow the robot to communicate with the base station.
