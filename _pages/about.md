# Christopher Allred

_PhD Candidate, AI Robotics Researcher, Software Engineer, Mechanical EIT_

---

Welcome to my website! If your curiosity has brought you here, you're in the right place. I love all things robotics and I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions to complex problems.

I am a robotics researcher focused on improving terrain cost estimation and dynamic motion learning for real-world robotic systems. My work emphasizes data-centric approaches to boost the performance and adaptability of legged robots. Explore my projects and research, and hopefully, you'll learn something new about the field of robotics!

In my free time, I enjoy a mix of hands-on and outdoor activities. I love 3D printing, playing the piano, and spending time camping when I can. I also like experimenting with tech in my home lab, especially running large language models locally.

One of my exciting moments was winning 1st place at Hackathon 2022, where my team and I developed a project that involved teleoperating a robot arm using virtual reality, which was a challenging but rewarding experience.
