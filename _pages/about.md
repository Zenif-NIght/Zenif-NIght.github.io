Hi, I am Christopher, a PhD student robotics researcher at USU. My expertise in both data science and robotic intelligence. With experience as a software engineer, I have a passion for building autonomous systems and computer vision applications. I have worked extensively with both wheeled and dynamic quadruped robots, utilizing ROS autonomous stacks to achieve successful research applications.

Through my work, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with talented researchers in the field and present my findings at top conferences such as IEEE IRC. My focus on developing robust systems for robot perception and control has allowed me to contribute to the advancement of the field and develop innovative solutions for complex problems.

My passion for robotics and commitment to advancing the field has driven me to continuously improve my skills and knowledge. I am excited to continue working in this dynamic field and to make significant contributions to the future of robotic intelligence.

## Collaboration
I believe that working together can bring different perspectives, expertise, and skills to the table, and lead to more robust and well-rounded research. It can also help to expand the scope of research and bring different research communities together to achieve common goals. Therefore, I would like to extend an invitation to collaborate and encourage other researchers to reach out to me for potential collaboration opportunities.
