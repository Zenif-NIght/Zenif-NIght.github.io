excerpt: 'The Unknown Building Exploration Simulator (UBES) software is built to investigate effective strategies for multi-robot exploration of unknown, indoor environments. The software allows the assessment of different exploration techniques, offering the flexibility to modify initial and target conditions, and account for potential agent loss. A total of 12 distinct algorithms commonly used in modern multi-robot exploration are implemented for baseline analysis. The simulation software includes complex building environments that can be user-defined or randomly generated according to several adjustable parameters. Agents also include user-modifiable features such as agent count, sensor range, LiDar characteristics, and inter-agent communication capability.'
