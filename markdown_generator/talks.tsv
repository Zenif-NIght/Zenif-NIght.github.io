Improving Methods for Multi-Terrain Classification Beyond Visual Perception	Conference proceedings talk	talk-1	2021 Fifth IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC)	2021-11-15	Taichung, Taiwan	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9699886	Terrain classification in mixed-surface unstructured environments is key for safe navigation, energy efficiency, and anticipating motion volatility. This is particularly true for dynamically moving legged platforms which are highly impacted by foot ground interactions. This research demonstrates terrain classification using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model trained on actuator time series data, particularly the difference in center-of-pressure (COP) and leg forces. The LSTM COPForce model showed a 97.5% accuracy in classification on three outdoor surfaces with small amounts of data and no additional sensors.

Terrain Dependent Power Estimation for Legged Robots in Unstructured Environments	Conference proceedings talk	talk-2	"2022 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC)
"	2022-12-06	Naples, Italy	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10023912	Gait-based legged robots offer substantial advantages for traversing complicated, unstructured, or discontinuous terrain. Thus increasing their use in many real-world applications. However, they are also challenging to deploy due to limitations in operation time, range, and payload capabilities due to their complex locomotion and power needs. Anticipating the impact of terrain transitions on the range and average power consumption is crucial for understanding operational limits in autonomous and teleoperated missions. This study examines strategies for forecasting terrain-dependent energy costs on five unique surfaces (asphalt, concrete, grass, brush, and snow). The field experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our combined proprioception and vision approach called MEP-VP. This hybrid framework only requires two seconds of motion data before returning actionable power estimates. Validation is conducted on physical hardware in field demonstration.
