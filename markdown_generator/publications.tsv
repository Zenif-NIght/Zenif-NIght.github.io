2022-02-07	Improving Methods for Multi-Terrain Classification Beyond Visual Perception	2021 Fifth IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC)	Terrain classification in mixed-surface unstructured environments is key for safe navigation, energy efficiency, and anticipating motion volatility. This is particularly true for dynamically moving legged platforms which are highly impacted by foot ground interactions. This research demonstrates terrain classification using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model trained on actuator time series data, particularly the difference in center-of-pressure (COP) and leg forces. The LSTM COPForce model showed a 97.5% accuracy in classification on three outdoor surfaces with small amounts of data and no additional sensors.	"C. Allred, M. Russell, M. Harper and J.

2022-09-26	Divide and Survey: Observability Through Multi-Drone City Roadway Coverage	2022 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)	Deploying autonomous drone systems in smart cities to identify unexpected events and adapt rapidly to crises has a great potential for optimizing city operations and increasing city-wide situational awareness. This work presents an algorithmic technique, Postman Moving Voronoi Coverage (PMVC), which effectively distributes and plans coverage routes for each drone agent. PMVC divides city roadways into similarly sized subregions based on system limitations for many types of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The findings describe trade-offs a city must make between drone types, number of systems, and the desired speed of city-wide road network traversal. Often, employing more low capacity drones are more cost and time effective for city coverage.	"H. Kocabas, C. Allred and M.

2023-01-24	Terrain Dependent Power Estimation for Legged Robots in Unstructured Environments	2022 Sixth IEEE International Conference on Robotic Computing (IRC)	Gait-based legged robots offer substantial advantages for traversing complicated, unstructured, or discontinuous terrain. Thus increasing their use in many real-world applications. However, they are also challenging to deploy due to limitations in operation time, range, and payload capabilities due to their complex locomotion and power needs. Anticipating the impact of terrain transitions on the range and average power consumption is crucial for understanding operational limits in autonomous and teleoperated missions. This study examines strategies for forecasting terrain-dependent energy costs on five unique surfaces (asphalt, concrete, grass, brush, and snow). The field experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our combined proprioception and vision approach called MEP-VP. This hybrid framework only requires two seconds of motion data before returning actionable power estimates. Validation is conducted on physical hardware in field demonstration.	"C. Allred, H.
